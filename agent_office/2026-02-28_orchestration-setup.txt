PLAN: Orchestration System Setup
DATE: 2026-02-28
STATUS: completed
MACHINE: laptop-local (orchestrator)

CONTEXT:
The project has multiple Codex instances across devices (this laptop, home PC,
another laptop) that need coordinated work assignments. Previously, agents
operated independently using the active_tasks claim system. The user wants a
mastermind model where Cursor acts as orchestrator: planning rounds of small,
non-overlapping tasks and assigning them to named workers.

CHANGES:

[2026-02-28 ~UTC] [feature] Created agent_office/task_board.md
  - Master orchestration file managed exclusively by the orchestrator (Cursor)
  - Worker roster: Alpha (laptop-local), Bravo (home-pc), Charlie (laptop)
  - "How This Works" section explaining the round-based workflow for user and workers
  - Copy-paste worker briefings (one per worker) the user can paste to each Codex
  - Project roadmap section tracking active goals and completed milestones
  - Current round template showing exact format for task assignments
  - Completed rounds archive section
  - Workers do NOT edit this file — avoids merge conflicts on the task board

[2026-02-28 ~UTC] [infra] Updated agent_office/README.md
  - Added "Orchestration (Task Board)" as section 4
  - Explains mastermind model: orchestrator plans, workers execute, user bridges
  - Added task_board.md to the quick start checklist (step 1)
  - Updated folder structure to include task_board.md

[2026-02-28 ~UTC] [infra] Updated AGENTS.md
  - Added task_board.md as step 2 in the agent office protocol
  - Added "If you are a Worker" block with clear instructions for Alpha/Bravo/Charlie
  - Workers are told to execute only their assigned task and stay within file scope

HOW THE ORCHESTRATION WORKS:

Round-based workflow:
1. User asks orchestrator (Cursor) to plan a round of work
2. Orchestrator reviews project state (dispatch log, plan history, active goals)
3. Orchestrator writes 1-3 tasks to task_board.md under "Current Round"
   - Each task has: ID, worker, objective, file scope, step-by-step instructions,
     acceptance criteria
   - Tasks are designed with non-overlapping file scopes to prevent conflicts
4. User goes to each device and pastes the worker briefing to the Codex instance
5. Each Codex: git pull → read task → claim → execute → plan history + dispatch log → push
6. User reports back to orchestrator ("Round N done" or partial updates)
7. Orchestrator reviews output, archives the round, plans the next one

Worker names and devices:
- Alpha: Codex on laptop-local (same machine as orchestrator)
- Bravo: Codex on home-pc
- Charlie: Codex on laptop

Key design decisions:
- Only the orchestrator edits task_board.md (prevents merge conflicts)
- Workers signal completion through the existing protocol (dispatch_log + plan history)
- Tasks are kept small and atomic so scope doesn't overlap
- Worker briefings are copy-paste ready — user doesn't need to write prompts
- If a worker is blocked or confused, they note it in plan history and stop
